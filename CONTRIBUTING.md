## 📝 Commit Message Guidelines

To keep our CHANGELOG clean, we follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
* `feat:` for new features.
* `fix:` for bug fixes.
* `docs:` for documentation changes.
* `style:` for formatting (no logic changes).

## 🤝 Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
4. Open a PR with a clear description of the problem you are solving.
